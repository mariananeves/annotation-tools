  <p id="newtool">
  <h3>How do I ask to add a new annotation tool?</h3>

  Please add an issue asking for that in our <a href="https://github.com/mariananeves/annotation-tools">Annotationsaurus GitHub page</a>.
  We'll add the tool to the list in GitHub and will try to evaluate it over some of the features.
  Please inform the URL of the tool and its publication (if available), as well as any addiitonal important infrmation.
  </p>

  <p id="newcriterion">
  <h3>How do I ask to add a new criterion?</h3>

  Please add an issue asking for that in our <a href="https://github.com/mariananeves/annotation-tools">Annotationsaurus GitHub page</a>.
  We'll analyze this new criterion, and eventually, add it at least the tools for which we can easily evaluate the criterion.
  </p>

  <p id="changecriterion">
  <h3>The evaluation of a criterion is wrong for a particular tool, could you correct it?</h3>

  Please add an issue asking for that in our <a href="https://github.com/mariananeves/annotation-tools">Annotationsaurus GitHub page</a>.
  Please also add some evidence for this change, such as by referring to the tool's publcation or tutorial, or by uploading a screenshot.
  We'll analyze the evidence, and eventually update the evaluation, otherwise, we'll contest your request.
  </p>

  <p id="trust">
  <h3>Why should I trust the evaluation that you carried out?</h3>

  We're researchers working on this are since many years, and we have not been involved in the development of any annotation tool.
  Therefore, we don not have any reasons to favor a particular tool.
  And we published our <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bib/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bib/bbz130/5670958">methodology</a> in a reputable journal.
  We certainly might have done some mistakes in the evaluationof some tools, but we offer the opportunity for the community to help us to keep our evaluation as up to date as possible.
  </p>

  <p id="collaborate">
  <h3>I find the project great, could I collaborate with you?</h3>

  Sure, we'de be glad to have the support of other researchers.
  Please check our contact info in our profile at <a href="https://github.com/mariananeves/annotation-tools">GitHub </a>.
  For instance, we envisage that there are many interesting projects for automatizing the evaluation of some of the criteria that we consider here.
